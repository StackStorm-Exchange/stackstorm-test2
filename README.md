## StackStorm Test Pack

NOTE: This pack is used for testing our pack Continous Integration system
and as such, it intentionally has actions which fail lint and other checks.

In addition to that, it also uses a non-master default branch on Github
(``aaa```) to verify that CI works with non-master default branches -
please don't change.
